Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK)
====

NLTK comes with some large pre-processed corpuses, which come to over 1GB of data.

This isn't much on a modern harddrive,
but you should be aware that NLTK can use up a lot of memory while in use.
It is also best to install it while on a fast network without download caps.

NLTK requires that you already have Python installed.
We will assume that you use the Miniconda method.

[Click here to see our Miniconda installation instructions](./python#installing-python-with-miniconda)

Once you have installed Miniconda and Jupyter,
run `conda install nltk` in the same console where you previously ran `conda install jupyter`.

You are now ready to start Jupyter and it will have the NLTK packages available to load when you are ready.
