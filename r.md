Installing R and RStudio
====

To interact with R, we'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development environment.
You will need to download and install both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

After downloading, open RStudio (you don't need to open R separately).

You're now ready to go!
