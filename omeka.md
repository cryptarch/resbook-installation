Omeka
====

There are two ways to use Omeka: either sign up for a free basic account at [https://www.omeka.net/signup](https://www.omeka.net/signup)
or download the newest version with extra bells and whistles from [https://omeka.org/download/](https://omeka.org/download/)

The first option is a lot easier.
If you just want to trial and gain initial experience with Omeka,
you are probably better off signing up for the free basic account.

The second option gives you ultimate customisability.
It comes at the price that it requires some Linux systems administration skills.

In particular, Omeka runs on what is known as a *LAMP stack*:

- **L**inux
- **A**pache Web Server
- **M**ySQL
- **P**HP

A LAMP stack not only needs configuration, installation and maintenance,
it also needs to be secured against malicious intrusion and exploitation.

So, if your organisation wants to host an Omeka site,
make sure someone with Linux experience is on staff first.
The Linux person also needs to have the time available to care for the LAMP stack and Omeka installation.

If you are an individual who wants to host their own Omeka site and you don't yet know anything about Linux systems administration,
you will need to find a way to learn.
([It is possible to teach yourself!](https://opensource.com/education/14/4/windows-to-linux-system-administration))

To find out more about the installation, care and feeding of an Omeka site,
see the [Documentation](https://omeka.org/codex/Documentation).
